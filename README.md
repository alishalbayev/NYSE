# NYSE
This project work is about the New York Stock Exchange. 
I am going to analyse different companies' economical structure and compare them.
I got datasets from Kaggle.com. Here is the link https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse.
Actually, on Kaggle they are 4 files, but I am using 2 of them. Because the massiveness of the data is too great.
And I suppose their volume is too enough to make good analysis.
I really hope at the end of this project I will have a good conclusion with interesting results.
